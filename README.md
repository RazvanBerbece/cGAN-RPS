# cGAN-RPS
Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) model for generating real 2D images of hands depicting Rock Paper Scissors shapes as used in the game.

Will use the CRISP-ML(Q) process model for the development of the project.

# Python

## Virtual Environment
The development process should be carried in a virtual environment. When cloning the repository, there will be no virtual environment available, but it can be created & accessed & exit by running the terminal commands below (Unix/macOS) in the root of the project :
```console
python3 -m venv env
source env
deactivate
```

Libraries should be installed for the project while in the virtual environment.

## Tech Stack
1. Tensorflow (& Keras)
2. sklearn
3. Python standard libs (numpy, matplotlib, cv2, etc.)
